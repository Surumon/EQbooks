Herbs, and their uses.
Many do not believe in the power of the herb, just as I have no tolerance for the ignorant. Here are some of the more common herbs and the uses I have found for them. Perhaps by testing things out for yourself you can come up with some useful concoctions. Lucerne: Years ago my brother Piter grew weak from practicing his summoning. A little of this fixed him right up. Sage Leaf: I have found this to be very useful for keeping your wits about you. I put this in tea for the nighttime patrolling guards in Tox, keeps them awake. Birthwart: Often given to babies with ear infections, this herb keeps the inner ear fluids in proper order. Fenugreek: This herb has many uses. It sharpens reflexes and improves hand-eye coordination. I often give it to the young Shadow Knights when they are testing to become true seekers of the dark truth. Maidenhair Fern: This little fern seems to have the most wonderful effects on ones emotions and I often use it for making my secret love potions. Mandrake Root: This is a very potent herb. It is said that even the essence of magic itself shies away from the extract of this root. Allspice: I have used this herb more times than you can imagine. Whenever I burn myself on the side of my cauldron I use Allspice extract to soothe the burn and quell the pain. Benzoin: I don't know for sure but this herb is rumored to actually raise the body temperature and is used to treat frostbite. Nightshade: Although poisonous by nature, if used correctly it can actually prevent the effects of most poisons. Mullein: Many people hang this herb above their beds. It is believed to keep the minions of Bertoxxulous away.

Two hundred years after Erud left the continent of Antonica to establish Erudin on the continent of Odus, our own ancestors, who have been known to some as Cazicites, grew in power and knowledge of ancient dark arts. The Erudites, once our brothers, criticized us, persecuted us, and eventually drove us out of the city we had helped to found. So great was their prejudice and unfounded anger toward us that they attacked us with terrible magics.  During the course of the conflict between us, our erstwhile brothers barraged us with ever larger and fiercer blasts of magic. Our own magic being rather formidable in and of itself, we were well   able to protect ourselves. An unexpected result of the collisions of many forms of magic in a single location, however, brought the Age of Enlightenment, and our own relations with the Erudites to a crashing halt.  Tremendous magical energy built in one spot until the very air vibrated with its power. When it seemed that the fabric of time and space themselves could no longer withstand the force, a great explosion tore open the earth with a blaze of light and a torrent of sound! A nearly fathomless hole was rent in the surface of Norrath leading deep into the planet, almost to the very Underfoot itself. It was in this cavernous space   that we founded our city, Paineel.

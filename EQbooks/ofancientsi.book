The Cleansers
The two mute lizards known only as One and Two were former Forsaken. They used their wisdom to cleanse the land of that to which they once belonged. In the end the Forsaken were the ones to end their lives.  The Caste of Bone Brethren This band of crusaders and mystics were assigned to Kurn Machata. They employed their knowledge of pain upon a great many foes of the empire. The entire caste was killed during a Kromdul assault which also left the tower in ruins.  Crusaders of Rok Nilok Rok Nilok was the Lord of this most feared order of crusaders. The end of this order was dealt by the demigod sibling, Byzola and Dimetreas for slaying their goblin followers. During a fierce goblin battle in the woods, the entire order was shrunken to the size of drixies and their heads started to glow. Rok Nilok's head was shining a different color to distinguish him from the others. This helped the goblins find them when they tried to escape certain defeat. The goblins then beheaded them all. So was their end.  Di Nozok The conjoined shamans Die and Dai took the name Di as a title. Their power was great and they could channel far better than others. The vile sarnak kidnapped them for fear they may channel with an ancient which could reveal a great sarnak weakness.  Sisters of Scale These mystic sisters each had distinct tattoos. They were also supreme in the ways of channeling. Together they could tap into the powers themselves. It is believed that the powers ended the lives of the sisters. Where this was is unclear. The skulls just appeared within Cabilis.

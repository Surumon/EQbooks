Over the centuries that followed, strange creatures began migrating into the Crystal Caverns. These monsters were a collection of the most deadly cave dwellers who inhabited the frosty caves of Velious. Unfortunately for the Coldain, these monsters used stealth and camouflage to hunt their prey. The crystal widows are a breed of arachnids that are almost entirely translucent and blend in with the walls of the crystal caverns catching many an unwary miner with their poison glass fangs. Stalagterrors are particularly nasty hunter which appears to be an ordinary ice stalactite, launching their frosty tentacles and opening their icy maws only when their prey is within reach. It was these foes and more which eventually caused the dwarves to abandon the Crystal Caverns and set out to build a new fortress more akin to Frostkeep. There are rumors that a few dwarves refused to leave their home in the center of the Caverns but what has become of them is unknown.

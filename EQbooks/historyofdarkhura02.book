EQ: The History of Dar Khura Vol. II
Mahlimik Dak, Grand Historian of the Jharin
The king found Dar Khura's words to be compelling. So convinced was the king that by the end of the day a decree went out to the tribe to afford Dar Khura any resource he needed to carry on his search. This research bore fruit sooner than any of the tribal elders could have expected. Dar Khura's research was quick to provided insight into one of the races of this new place. The Spiritists grew to know this race as the Akheva. They were determined to be a semi-immortal race. Research found that when one is slain, it is reborn anew. Over time, Dar Khura discovered that when an Akheva was reborn, a sacred member of the spirit realm was destroyed. This, he surmised, was the meaning of his initial visions. Dar Khura gathered an element of soldiers and moved into the darkness with the hope of gathering more information on this new race. That morning Dar Khura and his soldiers moved out of the sanctuary of the city walls and into the darkness. That was the last time that Dar Khura and his noble group of soldiers were seen. Only speculation was left behind. Our people have named the Shamanic sect of our tribe after that visionary spiritual leader. May the eyes of Vah watch over his spirit as they do ours.

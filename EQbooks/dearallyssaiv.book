Dearest Alyssa,
Fortified by Frosty Insurgency potions, I have begun exploring more of the area, traveling with hunting parties as they go out to bring in the food for the village. And such beasts they hunt, mammoths as big as houses, white leopards with black spots, creatures I had only read about and sometimes not even believed. Hunting the mammoth, especially, is a difficult undertaking. One party had a novel approach, taking along Gnomish Boils solution (a combination of bat fur and eyebright), they surprised a cow mammoth at night (which the solution turned nearly to day), in a scene of slaughter that was too much for me. Another group, however, was even more amazing, they went swimming for fish, using Vox's Vitality (froglok leg and sea spirit) to remain underwater for incredible lengths of time, with no apparent need to breathe. Once again I was amazed at the hardiness of these people, as they literally had to cut holes in the ice in order to reach the water and swim! Even so, the men came out of the water even more exhausted than Wolves Blood could repair, as they immediately visited my host for an even stronger brew made of white wolf skin and burdock root (called fleeting languor), before taking themselves to McQuaid's for more traditional libations. With any luck, this letter finds your sister well, and you as well as always. As always, I wish you and yours (even your father) my best, and hope that I may soon be able to return.
Your Jonas

Though it is true that no wizard walking the face of Norrath wields the power that I do, I must continue my research to be protected from all evil that lurks beyond Norrath. The search for immortality is not an easy quest to complete. I struggle each day to find the knowledge that has, for so long, been a dream of mine. Some have found crystals that offer healing powers. I must seek out such crystals. Perhaps I shall find the one crystal that give me the ultimate long life. While venturing through the frigid plains of the Barbarians, I came across some unusual ice crystals. These crystals radiated a strange, glistening glow. In order to fully understand the power within them, I brought the ice crystals back to my laboratory in Erudin and immediately started my experiment with them. My research continues.

P.P.S.
I also wanted to let everyone know what metals other races are using for these armors. We Humans and our Barbarian cousins use good old high quality steel, but others use other stuff. Wood and High Elves use Mithril, as you might expect. Dark Elves and Ogres both work with Adamantite. Iksar are using this stuff they call Skyiron, I guess they think it falls from the sky. Dwarves only work with Brellium, also not a surprise. Now the Half Elves have come up with a clever blend of Steel and Mithril that they call Rilsteel, it works well for them. Erudites have found a metal called Titanium and Halflings use something called Mercurium. I'm not familiar with either of those metals, yet. The Vah Shir and the Frogloks have followed their traditions, the cats use a type of Acrylia blessed by their ancestors and the frogs use something they call Valorite, some odd form of Valorium. The Trolls, well, they use iron. Yup, iron. I guess they are strong enough to use it for armor, and I can't deny that it protects them well. The oddest are the Gnomes. They've found some way using lightning or something to fortify bronze. I have no idea what fortifying bronze is, but that's what they do.

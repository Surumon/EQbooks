Dearest Allyssa,
I was overjoyed to receive your letter, but dismayed yet again over the words your father had for me. My resolve to learn pharmacopoeial skills to make me a prestigious consultant and worthy of your hand in his eyes has only redoubled. My education proceeds, as my host allows me to observe his treatments and preparations. Today a party of hunters came. They were preparing for a long expedition to the Icy Plains. Apparently these are as frigid as they sound, as the group was dressed in warm furs, even though these same men face the frozen avenues of Halas in no more than a kilt and a pair of boots. I was reminded of just how chill this was as I was sent out to the shops to find certain leaves and skins (cold enough to wrap myself in uncured skins). When I returned, my mentor arranged these on his bench where a couple of jars had been already opened. I watched with interest as he proceeded. First he removed a multicolored faerie wing (I forbore asking how he got it) and combined it with Yebamante to create what he referred to as "Troll's Essence". I asked why it was called that when there was no part of a troll in it, he said it was just how it had come to be called. Apparently this brew enhances the martial skills and constitution of those who take it. Reucoat's leaves were matched with an odoriferous piece of zombie flesh, to create "Spurn Affliction." Somehow the Reucoat reversed the effect of the putrid flesh, actually armoring the drinker against disease. Then a piece of wolf skin of the highest quality was cut from the hide, and combined with sticklewort. The resulting "Wolves Blood" was apparently intended as an energizer, reducing the need to rest from strenuous activity. Certainly hunting in these climes is always strenuous. I am sure that the skills I am learning will serve me well, and look forward eagerly to your next letter.
Your Jonas

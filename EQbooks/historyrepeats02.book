Anonymous Erudite Historian
Finally, the inevitable happened. Ognit channeled just a small amount of energy into the Hatch. It wasn't much, not even enough to kill a moss snake. However this time, the Living Wall began to shudder spasmodically and took on a pale, sickly color. The earthquake that resulted was truly terrifying. Chunks of stone began falling from the ceiling and the ground itself began to be ripped apart. From the huge gashes in the earth, the three saw terrifying creatures emerge. All about them were sounds of shrieking, crying and bellowing. The noises were both exclamations of excitement for finally being freed and rage for being imprisoned for such a long time. The three began to flee the hole in terror as the creatures began to swarm around them, their ears ringing from the unholy screams. As they made haste toward the surface, they came across a figure that looked to be an Erudite. The Erudite was walking slowly and limping slightly. He was filthy, covered with dirt and soot. His skin was pallid, as one who had not stood under the glare of harsh sunlight for ages. He wore a robe that was a splotchy brownish color. It was difficult to tell if this was the robe's original color or if it was the result of the filth that covered it. He turned quickly and upon seeing them, he spoke. "Gnomes, and a Barbarian woman of all things! I don't know whether I should thank you or draw the full sum of the life-force from your bodies right here and now!" Dagda pushed her way past the two gnomes, putting herself between them and the Erudite. Facing the strange man she asked, "Who are you?" He folded his arms across his chest and smiled slightly. He raised an eyebrow as he spoke, "My name is Dartain of the Dark Truth. I don't suppose you have any idea about what you have just done? Or perhaps I should say undone, do you?" He seemed to stare through their souls with eyes fierce yet lined with weariness. "Your meddling has caused the Wall of Living Stone to weaken once again. Though your actions have finally allowed me to break free after being trapped for so many a year, you have also allowed many of the denizens that were imprisoned behind that wall to escape into the world again as well." Even in the dim light, Ognit's face became visibly paled. Dartain continued, "The Hatch is still unharmed and appears to be functioning as it should. I believe the wall will repair itself again in time. While the breach remains however, there will be a steady flow of creatures escaping from the underfoot. I suggest you make haste out of this place and take warning to those above, so that they may prepare themselves." As he finished speaking, murky shadows made their way from the floor and encircled the dirty robes the strange man wore. As he disappear from view he softly muttered, "Finally, I am free."

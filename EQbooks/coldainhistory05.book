Inscribed by: Grand Historian Nicmar
While hiding out in the frigid caverns, a Coldain miner by the name of Glight Snowchipper received a vision from Brell. The vision was of a labyrinth of ice where the dwarves could hide from the ice giants. These caverns would be a twisting maze so that the invading giants would become easily lost and fall into the many deathtraps the dwarves would set up. These caverns of crystal would be the salvation of the Coldain race.  And so Glight presented his idea to Dain Frostreaver the First, son of Colin Dain and called Frostreaver for his efficiency in dispatching giants, and construction began. The Crystal Caverns were completed in a little under half a century. The timeliness of the project alone was proof to the Coldain that Glight had indeed been inspired by Brell. The true test of the caverns' effectiveness came 30 years later when the Kromrif discovered the location of the Crystal Caverns. Slagd Frozentoe of the Kromrif led an invasion force of two hundred and fifty warriors to the cavern, hoping to wipe the hated Coldain from Velious once and for all. Glight Snowchipper himself led the defense of the Coldain leading the ice giants deep into the confusing caverns. His magical pickaxe, aptly named Snowchipper, split many a giant's kneecap as the dwarves struck repeatedly from hidden passages and around dimly lit corners. Despite losing more than two thirds of his forces, Slagd and the remaining giants had almost made it to the Coldain city in the center of the caverns when Glight pulled off his greatest and final trick. Thirty thousand tons of ice and stone crashed into Slagd and his remaining giants after Glight and a few of his brave miners led them down a false passage. Unfortunately it was an act of self-sacrifice as the dwarf and his fellows were also buried in the intentional avalanche.

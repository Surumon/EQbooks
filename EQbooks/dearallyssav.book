Dearest Alyssa,
Truly I was overjoyed to hear that your sister has recovered, apparently without permanent harm. She is, as you, of fundamentally healthy nature, and it served her well in her recovery. I hope that she will be more careful in the future, however. Myself, life has settled into something of a routine, even the exotic becomes familiar with time I am finding. In an effort to see something new and different, I went seeking that shyest of creatures, the air elemental. Although an invader of our plane much like the fire elementals of Lavastorm, it is not aggressive but retiring, not even visible except when defending itself.  To find it, I prevailed upon my host to show me the way of combining feathers and stinging nettle to create a potion called Soul of the Incorporeal. This substance makes the normally invisible visible, and with it I was able to see the flighty but insubstantial sprites. They seemed to be very amused with themselves, playing tag from one side of the Icy Plains to the other, almost like children. However, I also witnessed a most primitive spectacle that day, fortified by another of my host's concoctions made of warbone chips and damiana leaves, one of the hunters wrestled a small bear with his bare hands. The Undead's Recourse solution certainly seemed effective, as he won rather handily, even though this "small" bear was 3 times even his own rather impressive size. I found the elementals to be better company, especially after partaking of Gulon's Impunity (made from ground figwort and and a minor lightstone) which allowed me, believe it or not, to sport through the air with ease, joining in their games.  However, when the fun was over I used Copal's Demise (evil eye eyestalk and horehound) to dissipate the magical effect, so that I could return on my own feet. As always, I await the day when we may be together again.
Your Jonas

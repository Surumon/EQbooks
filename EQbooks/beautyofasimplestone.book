EQ: The Beauty of a Simple Stone
Bansama Nysawi
I am a simple person and I find beauty in the simple things. I've been a crafter for a long time now. When I was a girl I found joy in making arrows for my father and his friends, and to this day I still find making things to be the most rewarding activity in my life. Recently, we discovered a new stone, hard as any rock, but with interesting shearing properties. If you break it just the right way you will get an edge sharper than any steel.  We've called this material Taelosian Stone. We've also found a version of this stone that has been altered by some tremendous force, and we've decided to call that Discord Stone.  It has the same properties as Taelosian Stone, but it has unusual additional properties that I can't fully describe. Not only is this stone beautiful, it is very useful. Once the stone is prepared (and that's a secret for another tome and another time), careful use of a file will produce a wonderful new arrowhead.  Make sure to keep the stone wet while you work with it. Using even common shafts, fletchings, and nocs, and it produces some wonderful arrows.

During the ancient days when the first city of the dwarves was under construction, dwarves were being sent across the lands and sea to find precious reserves of stone, crystal, and ore for the project. Ships sailed in and out by the dozens bringing supplies for the great project. One fleet of such ships was sailing across the South of Antonica to reach the unknown island that would eventually be Odus, where a quartz mine was being set up in the name of the dwarves. Led by the miner and explorer Colin Dain, the fleet of a dozen ships carrying about 200 dwarves ran into one of the worst storms Prexus had ever unleashed. Tossed and turned, flipped and torn the storm raged on for days as most of the dwarves huddled together in the ships' holds waiting for the seas to calm. When finally after eight days of turbulence the gales subsided and the dwarves crawled onto their tattered decks they found that six of their ships had been lost to the storm along with their crews and passengers. Worst of all not even the best of the remaining navigators or cartographers had a clue as to where they were. Even the stars in the sky could not be relied upon for navigation, as none of them were recognizable to the dwarves who had never been in this region before.

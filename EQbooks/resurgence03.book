Here's what you'll need to make your own symbol for your armor. Find the pattern book. I got my journeyman book from the same fellow that gave me the other book, I can't tell you where to find yours. I used the same technique to make the patterns with this book as the other and it works well enough. Once you have the patterns, you'll need to find the right temper. I've found that it's not too hard to get some water blessed by the gods if you go to the right temples. This is the base for a great temper. To it I added a shard of jade. This not only helps to give the temper color and grit, I view it as an offering to the Storm Lord for giving his blessing to my work. You'll need a jewelcrafter to do this for you, unless you also have skills in that area. My fingers are just too calloused for such fine work. Now, take the holy temper, your pattern and some warbone chips. The bone chips will help to soak up the liquid and prevent losing most of it. If you're good enough you'll be able to make an impressive symbol (sign, sigil... whatever you wish to call it) that will fit onto your armor perfectly. I must say that the ones I've made are wonderful, they make me proud of who I am. As you work on more difficult symbols, you'll want to replace the bone chips with other items, like fire opal, Shissar scales or even metallic dragon scales. All you need to do now is attach the symbol onto your armor. This is pretty simple, if you've done your work well enough. Just find yourself one of those augmentation sealers and use that. The symbol should fit perfectly into your armor piece. It's worth the work. It almost makes me want to grab my hammer, suit up in my new armor and stand guard at the gates of Qeynos myself. P.S.
I've been hearing that there are ways to make this armor better. My work has only been at the journeyman level, and I hear that there are three more complicated combinations for this armor. I've taken it upon myself to learn as much about this as I can. I've discovered that there are three other possible blends for the initial metal bars and that, of course, each race has their own take on what those should be. There's no need for any of you to go to the trouble that I had to in order to learn this, I'll gladly list the blend materials here. I'll list them in order of complexity, so you might want to get practice with the first items on the lists before trying those listed last. I don't know what most of this stuff is, so don't ask me to elaborate on them.

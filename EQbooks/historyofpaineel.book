Anonymous Erudite Historian
Having fled from persecution by our own kind, and then forced to flee our beautiful Paineel, we rebuilt our city here, not far from its predecessor. New Paineel was designed in the image of Old Paineel, but has come to outshine its namesake over time. Here, we Cazicites, favored by Cazic-Thule, have reached the epitome of knowledge and lore in the dark arts. No other necromancers on the face of Norrath have developed quite the skills we have, here in the heart of Cazic-Thule.  Necromancers from all over our world come to beg training from us. Even the great Miragul himself came here to learn from us, though his own   motives turned out to have been suspect. It was here, in the center of necromantic learning, that he gained enough of an understanding to enable him to create undead from a living being, though his results were not quite as he expected.  May Paineel stand as an inspiration to those who would spread disease and pestilence throughout Norrath, an ever growing center of knowledge and understanding.

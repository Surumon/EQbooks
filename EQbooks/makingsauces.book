Honestly, I just don't have time to do this. There are some fantastic new teas to try out and I don't want to waste my time writing, but Chowderly insisted, so here it is. I'm sorry if this is short. I'll tell you how to make one of my favorite sauces, lemon-butter. It's really not all that hard, though Chowderly would like you to think it is. Take some butter and mix it with some white wine. The proportions are for you to decide. Add a lemon. We have a good supply of lemons on board, so finding them shouldn't be an issue. It's just that simple. I've come up with several easy recipes for sauces to keep Chowderly busy, such as a simple grilling sauce, a spiced sauce, a smoking sauce, a butter sauce, a garlic-butter sauce, a barbeque sauce, a beer braising sauce and even a beer-batter. Now, if I were writing for my fellow brewers, I'd tell you something about the Taelosian teas. A wonderful tea that accepts a lot of flavors very well. Try it with mint! To make some of the darker teas, you'll need to find some ingredients out on Taelosia. Look for moldy leaves to give an earthy flavor for a black tea, or some tea plant sticks and greener leaves for a green tea. Anyhow, I've got to get to work. If Chowderly wants to prattle on about his new tuna recipes, let him spend his own time at it.

Dearest Allyssa,
I was saddened to hear of your sister's accident, and fervently hope that she is well again when this missive reaches you. It is shameful that the sunken portions of the dock area have never been fenced or railed for the safety of passersby. I saw no end of injuries like hers in my practice, and expect that there will be many more. I am doing very well, and have found the cold mornings much more endurable since my patron instructed me in the creation of the "Frosty Insurgency" solution from polar bear skin and Bistort. It is amazing how preferable this is to the usual barbarian method of dealing with cold (which is to drink one's self to a semi-stupor, beyond caring of the weather). Recently I managed to reverse things and teach my host a lesson in medicine, when a small child was attacked by a giant wooly spider and poisoned before the nearby patrol could arrive and dispatch it. The "Gorging Toxin" he made from a giant wasp venom sac and boneset herb was not sufficient to neutralize the arachnid's venom and he lacked the ingredients for a stronger brew. However, my mundane approach of lancing and draining the bite to draw the poison made the difference (I doubt it would have done alone, so strong is the bite of that creature) and the child lived, much to the appreciation of her father (who nearly cleft me with an axe when I made the incision). In gratitude he brought out his rarest component, Vox's Dust and showed me how to blend it with a ground fire drake scale to make the "Skin of Ro" specific against heat and flame. It was impressively effective, allowing him to stand in the flames of a bonfire without harm even as his clothing scorched and burned. Please give my best to your sister and mother, and my respects to your father.
Your Jonas

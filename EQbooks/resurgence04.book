Humans: Tusk of a small mammoth, horn of a woolly rhino, pile of gravel and metallic dragon scales. In fact, the dragon scales appear to be the very best blend material. Everyone is using it for their grandmaster armors.Barbarians: Permafrost crystals, chunk of condensed ice, pile of gravel and metallic dragon scales.Wood Elves: Mistletoe powder, polished serpent scale, small brick of Yttrium ore and metallic dragon scales.High Elves: Mistletoe powder, fungus sap, small brick of Yttrium ore and metallic dragon scales.Dwarves: Warbone chips, lava rock, pile of gravel and metallic dragon scales.Dark Elves: Russet oxide, small piece of Acrylia, midnight stone and metallic dragon scales.Half Elves: Permafrost crystals, fungus sap, great reptile tooth and metallic dragon scales.Ogres: Barbed bone chips, dark ore, pile of gravel and metallic dragon scales.Trolls: Barbed bone chips, globe of fear, great reptile tooth and metallic dragon scales.Halflings: Ivory, drop of mercury, small brick of Yttrium ore and metallic dragon scales.Gnomes: Warbone chips, chunk of condensed flame, small brick of Yttrium ore and metallic dragon scales.Erudites: Shark bones, drop of mercury, midnight stone and metallic dragon scales.Iksar: Loose scale, small piece of Velium, great reptile tooth and metallic dragon scales.Vah Shir: Porous mineral block, brick of black acrylia, small brick of Yttrium ore and metallic dragon scales.Frogloks: Barbed bone chips, gargoyle eye, great reptile tooth and metallic dragon scales. One other thing to keep in mind as you attempt more complicated armors. You will want to make a more generous offering in you temper as you make more powerful armor. The jade shard is fine for the journeyman, but an expert should use a lambent stone. The master should use crushed diamond dust, and the grandmaster should find some purescale ore.

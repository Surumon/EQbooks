When I applied high pressure to the crystals, an electric force emanated from each tip. This force was strong enough to polarize the floating particles that hovered around the tips of the crystal. With this luminescent energy surrounding the tips of the crystal, I knew that I must drain its power in order to complete this stage of my experiment. So far my research has been somewhat positive. Once I managed to drain the powers from the ice crystals that I found in the barbaric lands some time ago, I was ready to move on to the next stage of my experiment. By mixing this extraordinary energy with various materials, I managed to create a Rune of my very own, which I can use to store much power. My research continues.

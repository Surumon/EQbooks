Inscribed by: Grand Historian Nicmar
There's an old Erudite saying that states, "Dwarves are like time itself, neither can ever remain idle." This certainly proved true for the new settlement. The miners quickly discovered that the hard packed ice lying beneath the snow of Velious was as durable and malleable as stone. Being mostly quartz miners, the dwarves found they liked this ice just fine and were building all sorts of things with it in no time. The great walruses found along the coast proved to be an invaluable source of food and furs, although many a warrior fell to the beasts thinking "they're just dumb animals." It was for this reason and others that a small dwarven settlement was formed near the shores of the ocean in the Eastern Wastes. Through time the settlement became a town, and then a strong dwarven keep seemed to form as if a new mountain had been born. Named Froststone, for the ice it was built from, the dwarves realized that with the completion of this keep their stay on this strange new land was permanent. Unfortunately this time of peace for the dwarves was coming to an end as they ran into the first other intelligent life on Velious, the frost giants.

The trio said not a word to each other, and continued at a dead sprint toward the surface as the sound of an army of creatures rumbled directly behind them. Reaching the top of the ruins, they held their breath as they jumped into the cold water and wriggled their way with panicked speed through the rocky underwater cavern that lead into the new city of Paineel. After emerging from the water, the first breath they took was used to issue forth a scream of terror. All around them, terrible creatures of rock and stone wandered in the open throughout the streets of the new city of Paineel. Already, cries of alarm could be heard being raised from deep within the bowels of the city. Even more alarming was the fact that the earth still seemed to be shaking, even after all this time. Dagda in an effort to warn the Heretics of the impending danger shouted, "Horrible creatures from the earth have broken loose! Run for your lives!" Dabner exclaimed, "Brell Serilis help us all! They are everywhere!" Dagda gave both gnomes a shove forward and yelled, "Go! Run!" The three began at a dead run once again. She kept behind the gnomes to make sure they were both still alive and running. As he ran, Ognit smacked himself in the forehead screaming, "Oh gods! What have I done! Just keep running everyone!" Guards Menbuknar and Heridion stood near the entrance to the new city of Paineel. The pair of skeletal sentries stood staring out over the grassy alcove through hollow eye sockets that were long without flesh or blood watching over the new city of Paineel in eternal service to their Heretic masters. "Nooiiissseeey," Menbuknar said with a quiet disembodied voice like sandpaper in response to the sudden shouts. Guard Heridion took several steps forward and pointed, "Rooockssss." Hefting their swords above their head, the two skeletal guards shambled clumsily out into the courtyard and began to fight against the intruding earth elementals. As he swung away against the creatures made from earth itself, Menbuknar sniffed the air with a nose that wasn't there and rasped, "Gnoommmessss."

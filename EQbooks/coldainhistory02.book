Using typical dwarven logic, Colin picked a direction to sail in and decided that their only hope was to keep sailing in that direction until they spotted land. As the days and then weeks went by the only noticeable difference to the dwarves was that things began to get a lot colder. Some nights were so cold that many a dwarf froze to death on the decks, turned into a guardian statue of ice by the cruel weather. Only the morale boosting and determination of Colin Dain kept the dwarves' hopes alive as he popped from ship to ship assuring the dwarves that they would "Hit land soon, if'n not tommorow then the day after." Eventually Colin's words rang true as the dwarves did indeed spot a gigantic white landmass in the distance. Unfortunately the landing proved to be as deadly as the voyage there as a reef of icebergs both small and large begin to tear the small fleet apart. Not a single ship made it to what could only be thought of as a giant glacier intact. Most were torn apart far from the land, and many of the remaining dwarves met with icy deaths in the heart of the ocean. All in all ninety-four of the two hundred some dwarves who left from the Northern Hemisphere countless days before made it onto that icy beach. Not a single ship was serviceable. Colin Dain wasted no time in leading his people from the shoreline. He knew that they would have to find shelter to keep from dying in the cold. He also knew that they would need to find wood and other supplies so they could repair the remaining ships and set off for fairer lands. And so the quartz miners from the north settled in a nest of abandoned caves found about ten miles inland from where they landed, in the side of a giant mountain of ice and snow in the northernmost tip of the Great Divide.

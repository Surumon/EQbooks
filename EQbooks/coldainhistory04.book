Inscribed by: Grand Historian Nicmar
The frost giants make up the largest population in the Eastern Wastes and consider those lands their home. Needless to say they did not take kindly to the children of Brell building a fortress along their northeastern border. And so it was with great surprise that the dwarves woke up one day to find their home under siege by an army of giants. After days of vicious battle the dwarves realized that they could not possibly hold out against the giants. Colin Dain led the exile from their new home in the Great Divide to the only place they could go - deeper into the mountains. The ice giants followed them into the mountains and a small group of dwarves volunteered to stay behind while the others escaped. Colin Dain himself led the suicide ambush, buying his people enough time to escape the giants' reach. From this time onward the dwarves vowed to refer to themselves as the Coldain in honor of their beloved leader, and also that all the leaders of their people would carry the title Dain. From this day forward the Coldain were a new people born from the roots of dwarven kind. This event also established an enemy of the Coldain that will most likely remain until the end of time. As for Froststone Keep itself, all that remains are ruins in the Eastern Wastes marking the remnants of a once great citadel.

EQ: The History of Dar Khura Vol. I 
Mahlimik Dak, Grand Historian of the Jharin
This is the story of Dar Khura. As with the other sects of the Vah Shir, the Dar Khura took their name from one our greatest historic figures. We honor the memory of our fallen leaders through our actions each day. It is the duty of every Vah Shir to epitomize the values that make our civilization strong, for without these values we are no better than the creatures that wallow in the filth of the darkest caves. Dar Khura was the spiritual advisor to Vah Kerrath himself even before the ascension? or shifting. After the great event, it was his solemn conviction that we had not ascended to this world by mere chance, but that we were led here for a special purpose. Dar Khura focused on discovering that purpose and leading the tribe to fulfill their destiny. Shortly after our city's first walls were completed, Dar Khura went to King Kerrath and told him of a recurring vision he had been experiencing. In the dream, the shaman perceived some unknown force tampering with the balance of the spirit realm. An overwhelming feeling of urgency and desperation lingered with the Spiritist each time he awoke from the visions. Dar expressed to the king that it was his opinion that this was the purpose for their being delivered to this place.

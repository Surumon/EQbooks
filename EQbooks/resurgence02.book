Once you have a few bars of this blended metal, you might want to make them into sheets for plate armor. The bars can easily be melted into molds for chain armor, but for plate you'll need sheets. Just hammer them out like any other sheet, use water as you were instructed as a journeyman. Now you're going to need a pattern. This is where you'll have to do some research. I got my pattern book from a friend, you'll have to find someone willing to part with one. If you can find one you'll be able to figure out how to copy out the patterns you'll need. Once you have the patterns and the metal bars or sheets you can get to work. If you want to make the smaller pieces like wristguards, gloves or sleeves, you'll only need one bar of metal. You'll need two for larger and more complicated pieces like a helm or boots, and probably three for a chestplate or leggings. You'll also need a large brick of the same ore you used as a base for your blended metal to help fill in gaps and make any fancy filigree you want. If you're good enough you can make fine armor. Folks will be proud to wear it, but you'll be able to make it better. I'll tell you how later on. You'll do all this work in the forges in your home town. Well, unless you're a Gnome. For some reason they work in a toolbox of all things, with some stuff that looks to me a lot like junk. I'll probably never understand those little folk. Making the final piece for your armor will require a very special pattern. I had some trouble finding this pattern for my journeyman armor, but I'm glad I took the time. What you'll be making here is very personal, it's like your take on your own people. Me, for example, I follow the Storm Lord. I've always been the kind of fellow that likes to stand in heavy rain and feel in jab my face and arms. To me Humans are like that, they can stand up in any sort of storm and not only survive but enjoy it for what it is. So I completed my armor with the blessing of the Storm Lord.

# EQbooks
A bunch of EverQuest related books and lore for the Lost Books mod for Minecraft.
Find the mod here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1288323-forge-father-toasts-server-mods-lost-books-deadly

Installation
- Download the above files into their own directory.  I suggest the folder name EQbooks.
- For more common drops, move this directory to: config\LostBooks\common
- For rarer drops, move this directory to: config\LostBooks\unique

Note: These books are a collection of pre-written books by the amazing developers that have worked on EverQuest for years.  Their credit is well earned, and entirely their own.  I only wish to share their great amount of effort and creative writing.  None of these works are my own, nor do I claim any rights to them.

Enjoy and have fun!

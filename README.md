# EQbooks
A bunch of EverQuest related books and lore for the Lost Books mod for Minecraft.
Find the mod here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1288323-forge-father-toasts-server-mods-lost-books-deadly

Installation
- Download the above directory "EQbooks."
- This directory contains all the books, you do not need to make any changes to it.
- For more common drops, move this directory to: config\LostBooks\common
- For rarer drops, move this directory to: config\LostBooks\unique

These books are a collection of pre-written books by the amazing developers that have worked on EverQuest for years.  I have admired and enjoyed reading their works and their flavor text ever since I played EverQuest back in 1999.  Their credit is well earned, and entirely their own.  I only wish to share their great amount of effort and creative writing.
None of these works are my own, nor do I claim any rights to them.

Enjoy and have fun!
